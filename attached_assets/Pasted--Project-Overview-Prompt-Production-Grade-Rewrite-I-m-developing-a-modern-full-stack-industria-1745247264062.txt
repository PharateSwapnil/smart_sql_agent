üîß Project Overview Prompt (Production-Grade Rewrite)
I'm developing a modern, full-stack, industrial-level web application that serves as an alternative to tools like DBeaver, with enhanced AI-powered capabilities.

üß† Backend Components:
smart_sql_agent.py: Acts as an intelligent SQL agent capable of interacting with multiple databases. It can:

Answer general and technical SQL/database-related questions from users.

Auto-generate optimized SQL queries and scripts using LLMs.

Assist in database documentation, analysis, and schema recommendations.

db_connection.py: Responsible for dynamically connecting to various databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.) using SQLAlchemy and generating connection engines that interface with the smart agent.

üåê Frontend Stack:
To be developed using:

React (with TypeScript) for scalable component architecture.

Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive UI.

HTML5 for semantic markup. Flask to connect with python.

üîç Project Goals:
Create a robust, AI-integrated database management platform with the following pages:

1. Landing Page:
Modern UI with full project overview.

Key features, screenshots, and tech stack.

User registration and login functionality (JWT or OAuth).

Benefits over traditional database tools like DBeaver.

2. Database Connection Page:
Interface for selecting and configuring different databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.).

Dynamically integrated with db_connection.py for real-time connection testing and feedback.

Options to save connections securely (encrypted).

3. Smart SQL Agent Page (AI Chat Interface):
View all active and saved database connections.

Embedded prompt chatbox with history panel.

Interactive code editor with syntax highlighting and auto-complete.

Chat-based support for:

Writing complex SQL queries.

Schema exploration and transformation suggestions.

Optimization tips and real-time error checks.

Upload schema files (SQL/CSV) to auto-generate query templates or visual ERD diagrams.

üîë Key Features to Enhance Production Quality:
Authentication & Authorization: JWT-based secure login with user roles (Admin/Read-only).

Secure Storage: Encrypted storage of DB credentials.

Audit Trail: Maintain logs of user actions, query history, and schema changes.

Error Handling: Robust error capture, fallback mechanisms, and retry logic in connections.

State Management: Use Redux or Zustand for managing app-wide state and database session info.

Real-Time Feedback: Toast notifications, real-time query status, and error messaging.

API Layer: Build scalable REST or GraphQL endpoints in the backend.

Containerization: Docker support for full-stack deployment.

CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI for automated testing and deployment.

Cloud Ready: Deployable on AWS/GCP/Azure using serverless or containerized services.
